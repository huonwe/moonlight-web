// The screen as the compositor hands it over, through the ScreenCast portal's
// PipeWire stream — the capture route for an AppImage, which can hold no
// capability and therefore cannot read the scanout the way KmsCapture does.
//
// ── The same shape as KmsCapture, deliberately ──────────────────────────────
//
// start / acquire / release / stop, and frames delivered as KmsFrame. That is
// not laziness: KmsFrame is already a DMA-BUF descriptor — fds, offsets,
// pitches, a fourcc and a modifier — which is exactly what PipeWire hands over
// for a screen buffer. Wearing the same shape means GlConvert and CpuConvert
// take these frames unchanged, and the session's loop does not learn a second
// vocabulary.
//
// ── What differs from KMS, and matters ──────────────────────────────────────
//
//  - The compositor decides the format and can change it mid-stream: the
//    negotiated size is not known until the first param_changed, so start()
//    waits for it rather than promising a size it has not been told.
//  - Buffers arrive by PUSH on PipeWire's own thread. acquire() therefore hands
//    back the last one that arrived, exactly like the KMS path hands back the
//    last scanout — one frame is held, and release() lets it go.
//  - Some compositors give DMA-BUF (the fast path, importable by EGL) and some
//    give shared memory. Both are carried; `dmabuf()` says which, because the
//    GPU pipeline needs the first and only the CPU pipeline can use the second.
//    A compositor hands a DMA-BUF only to a client that names the modifiers it
//    can import (PipeWire's DMA-BUF negotiation): GNOME gave shared memory to
//    this route until it did (offerDmabuf, 29/09/2026).
//  - The pointer comes as METADATA beside the picture (that is what the
//    handshake asks for), so it is reported like KMS reports its cursor plane
//    and the client keeps drawing its own.
